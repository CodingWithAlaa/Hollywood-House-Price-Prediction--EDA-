Hollywood Price Prediction Visualization project objective:
The goal of this project is to predict house prices in Hollywood and visualize the results using interactive tools like Plotly. The project will involve data exploration, cleaning, and modeling to predict house prices based on various features.
Key Topics Covered:
🔹Dataset Overview – Understanding the structure and features of the housing dataset (e.g., square footage, location, number of bedrooms, etc.).
🔹Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, outliers, and preparing the data for analysis.
🔹Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing trends and patterns in the housing market (e.g., price distribution, correlation between features).
📌 Tools Used:
✅ Pandas 
✅ Seaborn 
✅ Matplotlib
✅Jupyter Notebook (for documentation and code execution)
